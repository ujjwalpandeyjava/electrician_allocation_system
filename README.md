## What I think about the algorithm

1. To make it a real product, It will need more technologies such as, react-redux 

2. The algorithm to set the electrician on a site will need better DB structure with each site, date and related details in it.

3. DB will have 3 different tables/collection for better mapping of the assigning and manipulation system

## What I think about the UI

1. We will need proper db and db calls as per the electrician, site, and the working site.
2. Each list will come from the db on render
3. Ever-time the data will update on db we have to re-render the component
